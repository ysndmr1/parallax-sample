        <h1>What is The Space</h1>
        <p>
          We often refer to our expanding universe with one simple word: space.
          But where does space begin and, more importantly, what is it? Space is
          an almost perfect vacuum, nearly void of matter and with extremely low
          pressure. In space, sound doesn't carry because there aren't molecules
          close enough together to transmit sound between them. Not quite empty,
          bits of gas, dust and other matter floats around "emptier" areas of
          the universe, while more crowded regions can host planets, stars and
          galaxies. From our Earth-bound perspective, outer space is most often
          thought to begin about 62 miles (100 kilometers) above sea level at
          what is known as the Kármán line. This is an imaginary boundary at an
          altitude where there is no appreciable air to breathe or scatter
          light. Passing this altitude, blue starts to give way to black because
          oxygen molecules are not in enough abundance to make the sky blue.

        <h1>A BRIEF HISTORY OF SPACE EXPLORATION</h1>
        <p>
          Ever since mankind began to look at the sky, our curiosity about space
          has been increasing day by day. Our process of exploring space
          continues from the first telescope we made to the spacecraft we send
          today, and we do not know how much further we will go, one day space
          travel is no longer a dream for us. In the 1930s and 1940s, Nazi
          Germany saw the possibilities of using long-distance rockets as
          weapons. Late in World War II, London was attacked by 200-mile-range
          V-2 missiles, which arched 60 miles high over the English Channel at
          more than 3,500 miles per hour. After World War II, the United States
          and the Soviet Union created their own missile programs. On Oct. 4,
          1957, the Soviets launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1,
          into space. Four years later on April 12, 1961, Russian Lt. Yuri
          Gagarin became the first human to orbit Earth in Vostok 1. His flight
          lasted 108 minutes, and Gagarin reached an altitude of 327 kilometers
          (about 202 miles). The first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, went into
          orbit on Jan. 31, 1958. In 1961, Alan Shepard became the first
          American to fly into space. On Feb. 20, 1962, John Glenn’s historic
          flight made him the first American to orbit Earth.

        <h1>LANDING ON THE MOON</h1>
        <p>
          “Landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth within a
          decade” was a national goal set by President John F. Kennedy in 1961.
          On July 20, 1969, astronaut Neil Armstrong took “one giant leap for
          mankind” as he stepped onto the moon. Six Apollo missions were made to
          explore the moon between 1969 and 1972. During the 1960s, unmanned
          spacecraft photographed and probed the moon before astronauts ever
          landed. By the early 1970s, orbiting communications and navigation
          satellites were in everyday use, and the Mariner spacecraft was
          orbiting and mapping the surface of Mars. By the end of the decade,
          the Voyager spacecraft had sent back detailed images of Jupiter and
          Saturn, their rings, and their moons. Skylab, America’s first space
          station, was a human-spaceflight highlight of the 1970s, as was the
          Apollo Soyuz Test Project, the world’s first internationally crewed
          (American and Russian) space mission. In the 1980s, satellite
          communications expanded to carry television programs, and people were
          able to pick up the satellite signals on their home dish antennas.
          Satellites discovered an ozone hole over Antarctica, pinpointed forest
          fires, and gave us photographs of the nuclear power plant disaster at
          Chernobyl in 1986. Astronomical satellites found new stars and gave us
          a new view of the center of our galaxy.

        <h1>INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION</h1>
        <p>
          The International Space Station is a research laboratory in low Earth
          orbit. With many different partners contributing to its design and
          construction, this high-flying laboratory has become a symbol of
          cooperation in space exploration, with former competitors now working
          together. The station has been continuously occupied since the arrival
          of Expedition 1 in November of 2000. The station is serviced by a
          variety of visiting spacecraft: the Russian Soyuz and Progress; the
          American Dragon and Cygnus; the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle; and
          formerly the Space Shuttle and the European Automated Transfer
          Vehicle. It has been visited by astronauts, cosmonauts, and space
          tourists from 17 different nations. Space launch systems have been
          designed to reduce costs and improve dependability, safety, and
          reliability. Most U.S. military and scientific satellites are launched
          into orbit by a family of expendable launch vehicles designed for a
          variety of missions. Other nations have their own launch systems, and
          there is strong competition in the commercial launch market to develop
          the next generation of launch systems.

          The James Webb Space Telescope is a space telescope for infrared
          astronomy. It is the most powerful telescope ever sent into space.
          Planned to be the partial successor to the aging Hubble Space
          Telescope, it was developed under the leadership of NASA and with
          support from the ESA and CSA. It was launched in December 2021 and
          entered orbit in January 2022.
